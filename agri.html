        in the Future
        Feeding A Hungry Nation</strong></h2>
        <p >By 2050, it is expected that the world’s population will grow to nearly 9 billion; thus increasing
             our need for food by more than 100 percent. Currently, 1 in 8 people, or 842 million, struggle
              with hunger every day. Even more so, roughly 1 billion people in the world are food insecure,
               meaning they lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. While 
               agriculture has evolved in order to meet these intensely growing food demands, farmers
                will need to increase food production by 70-100 percent to meet global nutrition needs.
            We already know that there is relatively little available land on which to cultivate food. 
            The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) projections indicate that
             80 percent of the additional food required to meet demand in 2050 will need to come from land already under cultivation.
              The result is that our farmers and food producers must produce those higher yields using the same (or less) acreage than
               they use
               today while relying on fewer natural resources.</p>

<p>We are very fortunate in the United States to have a strong economy, a dedicated workforce, and good,
     diverse land from which to cultivate crops. In 2016, U.S. consumers spent only 10% of personal disposable income on food.
      However, there are still nearly 24 million Americans living in food deserts today, without ready access to affordable nutrition.
       These food deserts are not just in one area of the country; they exist throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The success of our country is dependent on the success of other countries. Consumers in other parts of the world must spend 50% or 
    more of
     their income on food, and this is devastating for them. By providing people with the tools they need to lift themselves out of
      poverty, achieved by first fighting malnutrition, we create a more stable world. For every 5% drop in income growth in a
       developing country, the likelihood of violent conflict or war within the next year increases by 10%.</p>

<h2>Animal Rights and Other Non-Governmental Organizations Are Working to Impact Our Food Choices and Food Supply</h2>
<p>We are quietly losing our ability to provide affordable food for our nation. Farming and ranching are under attack in the United
     States, and so are your rights to feed your family. Extremist groups are working to control farming, ranching land use, water
      use and to restrict animal ownership.</p>
<h2>Pushing An Ideology</h2>
<p>Those involved in the "Food Elitist" and animal rights movements are focused on an ideology, insisting that others must comply 
    with their ideals. In order to force the public to comply with their agenda, animal rights organizations, and their affiliated
     groups are relentlessly pushing new mandates and regulations that will ultimately both limit food options available to all 
     Americans and limit the availability of affordable food. There is even a “think tank” group based in Washington D.C. that 
     recommends a 40% tax on beef and a 20% tax on other meat products. Read more about it here: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/11/19/uk-researchers-tax-food-to-reduce-climate-change/</p>
 <p>We need to protect our nation’s ability to produce food so that we do not become reliant on other countries to feed our nation. 
     Our farmers and ranchers must be allowed to make decisions based on scientific reasoning and without being obstructed by non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) that know nothing about agricultural practices.</p>
