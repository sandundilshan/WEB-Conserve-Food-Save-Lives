        in the Future
        Feeding A Hungry Nation</strong></h2>
        <p >By 2050, it is expected that the worldâ€™s population will grow to nearly 9 billion; thus increasing
             our need for food by more than 100 percent. Currently, 1 in 8 people, or 842 million, struggle
              with hunger every day. Even more so, roughly 1 billion people in the world are food insecure,
               meaning they lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. While 
               agriculture has evolved in order to meet these intensely growing food demands, farmers
                will need to increase food production by 70-100 percent to meet global nutrition needs.
            We already know that there is relatively little available land on which to cultivate food. 
            The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) projections indicate that
             80 percent of the additional food required to meet demand in 2050 will need to come from land already under cultivation.
              The result is that our farmers and food producers must produce those higher yields using the same (or less) acreage than
               they use
               today while relying on fewer natural resources.</p>
