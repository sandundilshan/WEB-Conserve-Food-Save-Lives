  <p>According to the 2020 Global Nutrition Report (GNR), 
    overcoming deep inequities within food and health systems is 
    central to ending malnutrition.<br> 
    The unjust systems and processes that engender these inequities must also 
    be challenged in our progression towards creating a 
    world free from malnutrition. <br>Investing in nutrition 
    and ending inequity are intertwined goals, and in order to 
    overcome the global nutrition crisis equitably, we must direct 
    resources and programmes towards those most affected by malnutrition.</p>
