          After steadily declining for over a decade, global hunger is again on
          the rise. Conflicts and insecurity are among the root causes.
          Today, almost all the world’s major food crises – 10 out of 13 – are
          driven by conflict. Of the more than 800 million people facing hunger,
          60 percent live in conflict-affected countries. Removing China and
          India, this proportion jumps to 90 percent. The youngest among us
          pay the heaviest price: almost 80 percent of all stunted children are
          to be found in war-torn nations.
          UN Security Council Resolution #2417 (2018) recognizes the link
          between conflict, violence and hunger; expresses deep concern
          about the threat of famine facing millions of people in armed conflicts
          and condemns the use of starvation as a method of warfare.
          Whereas hunger alone may not lead to violence, lack of resources
          and a sense of injustice can be dangerous when overlaid with sectarian or
          ethnic differences. Grievances over resources may be
          further exploited by individuals and groups with an interest in
          fomenting unrest.
          The fact is that food is foundational. Without peace, the global goal of
          Zero Hunger cannot be achieved by 2030; and while there is hunger,
          we may never have a peaceful world.
          This is why the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has
          teamed up with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
          (SIPRI). The aim is a deeper understanding of the complex
          relationships between conflict and hunger and, conversely, of the
          contributions of food assistance to improving the prospects for
          peace.
          Away from the theoretical models, the people portrayed in this
          exhibition live at the crossroads of hunger and conflict. This is where
          they will remain, unless conflicts are ended, and human potential is
          safeguarded through just and equal access to resources.

            <h3>In 2021, we are now facing unprecedented levels of hunger, with 41 million people at risk of starvation – that’s almost eight times the population of the Republic of Ireland. This is primarily being driven by conflict.
              There are two ways that we can stop people dying from conflict-related hunger:</h3>
          
                <li><strong>By providing food to those in conflict-affected areas</strong></li>
                <li><strong>By convincing global leaders to stop hunger from being used as a weapon of war</strong></li>

  <pre><p><h3>The two-way links between hunger and conflict are well established. violent conflict is destructive to virtually every aspect of a food system, from production, harvesting, processing, and transport to input
