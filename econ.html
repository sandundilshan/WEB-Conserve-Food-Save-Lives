<p align="center"><i>Seen through a purely economic lens, the continuing prevalence of global <br> hunger is bad for business. It inhibits productivity, slows economic growth, and <br>
    places unnecessary burdens on health and education systems. As a <br>
     humanitarian organization, that’s not what drives Concern’s mission, but the <br> data are useful in persuading others of the importance of achieving zero hunger.</i></p>
    <ul> <h2><strong>FAST FACTS</strong:></h2>
<li>In 2015, the UN estimated that it would cost $267 billion (roughly 0.3% of the global GDP) each year to end hunger by 2030.</li>
<li>Undernutrition in children can cost a nation’s economy hundreds of millions of dollars per year. In some countries, the cost is in the billions.</li>
<li>The Food and Agriculture Organization reports a correlation between increased levels of hunger and slowed or declined economic growth.
</li>
<li>Rapid response to the warning signs of a food crisis saves lives, averts famine, and reduces the cost of emergency response.
</li>
<li>For every dollar invested in reducing childhood malnutrition, there is an estimated return ranging from $17 to $22.
