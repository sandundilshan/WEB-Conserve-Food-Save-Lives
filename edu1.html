<p><h2>Hunger and poor-quality education are no doubt interlinked, and continue to plague children across the globe.<br>
That’s why at Rise Against Hunger, we actively seek to nurture and nourish the generation of tomorrow by changing their world today.<br>
We do this the best way we know how – providing substantial meals.<br></p>

<p>Most children from low-income families go to school hungry, which in turn, hurts their performance in school.<br>
Going hungry does not always means the same thing to everyone. For some, there may be no food in the house and no money to buy any.<br>
Maybe there is food in the house, but not enough to feed all members of the family. Whatever the situation, more often than not,
 kids who don’t have continuous access to three healthy meals a day are much more likely to face unhealthy, unsuccessful and uncertain
 futures.</p>
<p><h2>Rise Against Hunger meals are provided in schools to encourage increased enrolment and attendance.
Our uniquely designed meals provide a comprehensive array of micronutrients, including enriched rice,
soy protein, dried vegetables and 23 essential vitamins and nutrients. Supplying students with these 
regular meals means that they are provided with the necessary energy to perform.<br> When students are no 
longer hungry, they are able to concentrate and succeed academically, opening doors for future opportunities.<br></h2></p>  
<p><h2>Our meals are so much more than just meals, they give children peace of mind.<br>
 With access to food every day, children become less concerned about where their next meal is coming from,
 and instead, focus on their education and bettering their futures.</h2></p>

<h2>Why Education is crucial to achieving SDG-2</h2>
<p>Education is key to acquire the necessary knowledge to increase agricultural production and the income of small farmers,
especially women and indigenous peoples, while respecting the environment, the biodiversity and the resources of each region.<br>
Correct and up-to-date knowledge also helps to prevent problems potentially causing famines, such as drought, floods, and other
disasters.<br>

<h2>Access to Learning objectives for SDG-2</h2>
<p>At this level, learners get acquainted with the tastes and textures of different foods.
They develop the required abilities to identify healthier food options such as fruits and vegetables,
thus making healthier choices, and allowing them to serve as role models within their schools and their
surrounding communities later in life.<br>

<h2>Primary Education</h2>
<p>Through gardening activities, combined with eating food they produce themselves, learners
 at this level develop healthy dietary practices. They also develop the required ability to read and interpret labels,
ingredients' lists and health labels.<br> Furthermore, they learn to appreciate indigenous and local perspectives on ways
 of living together and using existing resources in a sustainable manner.<br>
